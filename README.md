The developed web application is a prize verification system constructed using HTML, CSS, and the Django framework. Its primary function is to enable users to determine their prize status by querying a database containing relevant information.

Technical Implementation
Frontend: The user interface is crafted using HTML and CSS, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. HTML structures the content, while CSS styles the layout and appearance.
Backend: Django serves as the foundation for the application's backend logic. It handles user interactions, database queries, and data processing.
Database: A database is utilized to store prize-related information, including participant details, prize statuses, and any associated criteria.
Functionality
The application offers a straightforward user interface where users can input necessary details, such as their participant ID or other relevant information. Upon submission, the Django backend processes the input, queries the database, and retrieves the corresponding prize status. The retrieved information is then displayed to the user, clearly indicating whether they have won a prize.

Key Features
User-friendly interface for easy prize verification.
Efficient database interaction for rapid query processing.
Clear and concise presentation of prize status information.
Robust backend logic to ensure accurate data handling and verification.
Potential Enhancements
Error handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected inputs or database issues.
Security: Strengthen security measures to protect sensitive user and prize data.
Performance optimization: Optimize database queries and application logic for improved response times, especially under high load.
Additional features: Consider incorporating features such as prize details, winner lists, or social sharing options to enhance user experience.The developed web application is a prize verification system constructed using HTML, CSS, and the Django framework.
